# College Athlete Virtual Manager

Welcome to the College Athlete Virtual Manager GitHub repository. This project empowers college athletes to monetize their Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) through streamlined brand collaborations and personalized outreach.

## Project Overview

The College Athlete Virtual Manager is a cutting-edge platform that bridges the gap between college athletes and potential brands. Using advanced AI technologies, the platform facilitates seamless communication, script generation, and brand outreach to maximize NIL monetization opportunities.

## Pipeline Steps using SuperAGI:

1. **File Toolkit:**
   - Read and process the athlete's bio-data file containing their past games, values, and preferred brands.
   - This step can be automated for future scalability.

2. **Google Search Toolkit:**
   - Fetch alternative brand products from Google Image Search based on the athlete's preferred endorsement brands.

3. **WebScraper Toolkit:**
   - Extract contact email addresses and brand mission statements for the top 10 alternative brands.

4. **Llama 2 LLM:**
   - Utilize the athlete's bio and values to draft personalized email scripts for each brand.
   - The Llama 2 LLM model tailors emails to align with each brand's mission.

5. **Email Toolkit:**
   - Automatically send tailored emails to the 10 brands' contact email addresses using the drafted scripts.

6. **Optional - Generative Image:**
   - Create a generative image of the athlete holding a product category, enhancing brand alignment.

7. **Future Enhancement:**
   - Incorporate the athlete's pricing information from college listing marketplaces into email communication.
